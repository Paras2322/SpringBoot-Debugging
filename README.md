**Introduction**
Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors or bugs within a software application. It involves stepping through the code, inspecting variables, and analyzing program flow to understand and fix issues.

**Setting Up Your Environment**
To debug Spring Boot and Java applications effectively, you need a development environment configured with the necessary tools. Here are some steps to set up your environment:

- Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have the appropriate JDK version installed on your system.
- Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio Code. These IDEs provide powerful debugging capabilities.
- Configure Debugger: Familiarize yourself with the debugger in your chosen IDE. Learn how to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.
- Set Up Spring Boot Project: Create or clone a Spring Boot project to work with. Ensure your project setup includes necessary dependencies and configurations.
  
**Debugging with Breakpoints**
Breakpoints are markers placed within your code that pause program execution when reached. They allow you to inspect the state of your application at specific points and track down bugs effectively. Here's how you can use breakpoints:

- Placing Breakpoints: Identify areas of interest or suspected issues in your code and place breakpoints at those locations.
- Running in Debug Mode: Start your Spring Boot application in debug mode from your IDE.
- Stepping Through Code: Once the application hits a breakpoint, you can step through the code line by line, observing variable values and program flow.
- Inspecting Variables: Use the debugger to inspect the values of variables at different points in your code. This helps in understanding the state of your application and identifying discrepancies.
